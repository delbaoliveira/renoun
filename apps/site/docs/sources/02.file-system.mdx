## Directories

Directories are a way to organize your documentation into a tree structure. This is useful for organizing your documentation into sections and subsections. Directories can contain other directories, files, and collections.

## Files

Files are the building blocks of your documentation. They can contain content, metadata, and other files. Files can be written in Markdown, MDX, TypeScript, or any other format that you prefer.
