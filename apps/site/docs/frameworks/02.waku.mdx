Renoun enhances [Waku](https://waku.gg/) by providing features like [collections](/collections), [syntax highlighting](/components/code-block), and [type documentation](/components/api-reference), making it easier to create accurate and engaging content for blogs, documentation, and design systems.

## Install

To use Renoun with Waku, youâ€™ll need a Waku project. If you don't have a project yet, you can create one using Waku's `npm create waku` command:

```bash
npm create waku@latest
```

Now in your Waku project, let's install Renoun:

<PackageInstall packages={['renoun']} />

## Setup

Modify the `waku` scripts located in the `package.json` file to integrate Renoun into your Waku project. This ensures the Renoun process starts alongside your Waku server, enabling the full functionality of Renoun:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun waku dev",
    "build": "renoun waku build"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The `renoun` CLI needs to be part of the `dev` and `build` scripts to ensure
  features like collections and syntax highlighting work in your Waku app.
</Note>

## Start

Now you can start your Waku server with Renoun integrated:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Congratulations, you've successfully set up Renoun with Waku! You can now create [collections](/collections) or use one of the many [components](/components) available to enhance your content and documentation.
