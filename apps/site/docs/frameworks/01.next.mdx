}

## Install

To use Renoun with Next.js, start with a Next.js project. If you don't have a project yet, you can create one with the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Setup

Next, modify the `next` scripts located in the project's `package.json` file to use the Renoun CLI. This will ensure that the Renoun process starts before your Next.js server:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "renoun next dev",
    "build": "renoun next build"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  This command is necessary to enable Renoun features in your Next.js project.
  The `renoun` CLI starts a WebSocket server that communicates with components
  and utilities in your project to provide performant syntax highlighting and
  code analysis.
</Note>

## MDX (Optional)

To enable writing MDX content in your Next.js application, we will use the `@next/mdx` and `@renoun/mdx` packages. These packages allow you to author MDX content in your Next.js project and ship with pre-configured plugins that include reasonable defaults.

<Note>
  This step is optional and only necessary if you plan to use MDX in your
  project. Additionaly, you can skip adding the `@renoun/mdx` package if you
  want to configure your own MDX plugins.
</Note>

First, install the Next.js MDX plugin and the Renoun MDX plugins:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @renoun/mdx
```

Now, add the plugin to your `next.config.js` file while optionally including the pre-configured `remarkPlugins` and `rehypePlugins` from `@renoun/mdx`:

```js
import createMDXPlugin from '@next/mdx'
import { remarkPlugins, rehypePlugins } from '@renoun/mdx'
import webpack from 'webpack'

const withMDX = createMDXPlugin({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins,
    rehypePlugins,
  },
})

export default withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
})
```

## Webpack Configuration

Finally, we need to alias `js` files since `renoun` is an ESM package. We also need to silence critical dependency warnings for `@ts-morph/common` as these come from the `ts-morph` package `renoun` depends on. This is necessary to prevent warnings from appearing in the console:

```js
import createMDXPlugin from '@next/mdx'
import { remarkPlugins, rehypePlugins } from '@renoun/mdx'
import webpack from 'webpack'

const withMDX = createMDXPlugin({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins,
    rehypePlugins,
  },
})

export default withMDX({
  output: 'export',
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'md', 'mdx'],
  webpack(config) {
    /* Resolve .js files to .ts and .tsx */
    config.resolve.extensionAlias = {
      '.js': ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js'],
    }

    /* Silence critical dependency warnings for @ts-morph/common */
    config.plugins.push(
      new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(
        /\/(@ts-morph\/common)\//,
        (data) => {
          for (const dependency of data.dependencies) {
            delete dependency.critical
          }
          return data
        }
      )
    )
    return config
  },
})
```

## Start

Now you can start your Next.js server with Renoun enabled:

```bash
npm run dev
```
