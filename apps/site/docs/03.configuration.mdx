This guide will help you configure renoun in your project.

## renoun.json

The `renoun.json` file is used to globally configure components and utilities for the entire project. This file should be placed in the root of your project:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://renoun.dev/schema.json",
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun"
  },
  "site": "https://renoun.dev",
  "theme": "theme.json"
}
```

## Git Information

Renoun provides a simple way to integrate with Git. This allows you to view the commit history of your documentation site and see the changes made to each file:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun",
    "branch": "main",
    "provider": "github"
  }
}
```

## Site

The `site` property is used to define the URL of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "site": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```

## Themes

Themes are powered by <a href="https://shiki.style" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shiki</a> and are used to define the themes used to highlight syntax in code blocks. You can create your own theme or use a pre-built theme:

```json
{
  "theme": "theme.json"
}
```
