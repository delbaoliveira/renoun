This guide will help you configure renoun in your project.

## renoun.json

The `renoun.json` file is used to globally configure components and utilities for the entire project. This file should be placed in the root of your project:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://renoun.dev/schema.json",
  "theme": "theme.json",
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun"
  },
  "siteUrl": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```

## Themes

Themes are powered by <a href="https://shiki.style" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiki</a> and specify how source code is highlighted in the `CodeBlock` and `CodeInline` components. You can use a bundled theme or create your own theme.

### Bundled Themes

To use a bundled theme, you can reference a <a href="https://shiki.matsu.io/themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valid theme by name</a>:

```json
{
  "theme": "nord"
}
```

### Custom Themes

To use a custom theme, you can reference a JSON file that defines a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VS Code compatible theme</a>:

```json
{
  "theme": "theme.json"
}
```

## Git Information

Git can be used to set the `source`, `branch`, and `provider` of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "source": "https://github.com/souporserious/renoun",
    "branch": "main",
    "provider": "github"
  }
}
```

## Site URL

The `siteUrl` property is used to define the URL of your documentation site. This is used to generate the canonical URL for each page:

```json
{
  "siteUrl": "https://renoun.dev"
}
```
