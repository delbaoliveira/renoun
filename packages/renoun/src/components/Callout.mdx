Highlight key messages, provide helpful guidance, and clearly communicate warnings or crucial information to enhance understanding within your content.

- Only use callouts when they are essential to the reader's experience and success.
- Limit the number of callouts to one or two per section to avoid overwhelming the reader.
- Avoid placing callouts consecutively, as this can reduce their effectiveness.

## Variant Overrides

To override the default variants of the `Callout` component, you can use the `Callout.variants` method. This method allows you to customize the icon and style of the callout based on the variant:

```tsx allowErrors filename="mdx-components.tsx"
import { Callout, MDXComponents } from 'renoun/components'

export function useMDXComponents() {
  return {
    ...MDXComponents,
    Callout: Callout.variants({
      warning: {
        icon: '‚ö†Ô∏è',
        style: {
          backgroundColor: 'yellow',
          color: 'black',
        },
      },
      important: {
        icon: 'üì£',
        style: {
          backgroundColor: 'red',
          color: 'white',
        },
      },
    }),
  }
}
```
